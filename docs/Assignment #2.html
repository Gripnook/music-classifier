</p><h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>
<i>
The following is offered with apologies to the vast majority of
students who do their work honestly and take their university learning
seriously:
</i>

</p><p>
Your instructor takes academic integrity seriously and has no
tolerance for plagiarism or any other form of academic misconduct.
Failure to respect these guidelines will result in you receiving a
grade of <b>zero</b> on this assignment.

</p><p>
Acceptable collaboration between students, provided it is acknowledged explicitly in your report and code, might include:

</p><ol>
<li> discussing some aspect of the assignment specifications in attempting to understand a particular point
</li><li> discussing broadly the additional machine learning approaches you experimented with
</li><li> discussin a problem you encountered while programming your version of the learning algorithm
</li></ol>

Sharing of any computer code between students, or re-using any code from a third party (e.g., open source) is acceptable, <b>provided that you indicate this explicitly at the start of your report and (as comments) in the source code</b>.  In this case, only the portion of work that you did <b>individually</b> will be considered toward your grade.

<p>
<b>Unacceptable collaboration</b> and violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to:

</p><ol>
<li> including any code that was not your own and failing to indicate so
</li><li> copying part of another student's report
</li></ol>

If you are uncertain about any of these guidelines, please discuss with your instructor as soon as possible.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Modern classification techniques can be used to distinguish and 
categorize many things which some people may consider uniquely human. In
 this assignment you will use two basic classification algorithms to 
divide songs in ten music genres: classical, country, edm_dance, jazz, 
kids, latin, metal, pop, rnb, and rock.
</p>

<h2> Preparation</h2>

<p>
  This assignment is organized as a kaggle competition. To participate 
you will need to create a kaggle account using your McGill email. Once 
you have your account, go to the link posted on moodle to join the 
competition.
</p>

<p>
  Before doing any classification, you will need to download the data 
found in the 'Data' menu of the kaggle competition. There you can 
download a zip file containing a CSV file and two subdirectories, 
containing training and testing data. The data are a set of files, each 
corresponding to a single song. The CSV file, <tt>labels.csv</tt> contains the labels for the songs in the training directory.
</p>

<p>
  Every line in the song files consists of 12 decimal numbers, 
corresponding to the frequency analysis of a small segment of the song. 
There are between approximately 300 and 1300 segments per song, 
depending on the length, beat, and timbre of the music.
</p>

<p>
  Each line can be thought of as a 12-dimentional feature vector with genre label of that song.
</p>

<p>
  Your first task is to download these files, and load them into your 
program so that they may be manipulated. The files are in CSV format, so
 you may benefit from the use of a dataframe library (e.g., pandas in 
python). Additionally, you should split your data into separate training
 and testing sets.
</p>

<p>
  You may wish to start by using a small subset of the training data for
 testing purposes, making sure that you don't also train on these 
examples.  This will allow you to gain confidence in the performance of 
your classifier before you try it with a greater portion of testing 
data, and eventually, validating it on the competition test set.
</p>

<h2>Gaussian classifier</h2>

<p>
  The first type of classifier you will build is a Gaussian classifier.
</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>
  For each genre, calculate the 12-dimensional mean vector and 12x12-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrix</a>
 from your training set. These 12+144 numbers fully describe the 
probabilistic model of the genre. You should have one mean vector and 
one covariance matrix for each of the six genres.
</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>
  With the model trained you will now want to evaluate it on the testing
 set. This model allows you to make predictions both on the feature 
vectors and on songs as a whole. To make a prediction on a new feature 
vector <img src="Assignment%20%232_files/x.png"> simply plug it into the following equation, giving the unnormalized negative log likelihood (UNLL) for each genre:
</p>

<img src="Assignment%20%232_files/UNLL_eq.png" hspace="20">

<p>
  where <img src="Assignment%20%232_files/mu.png"> is the mean vector of that genre, and <img src="Assignment%20%232_files/sigma.png"> is its covariance matrix.
</p>

<p>
  The UNLL is an indicator of the probability of a feature vector 
belonging to a song of a specific genre. The lower the UNLL, the higher 
the probability. Therefore, the genre with the lowest value of UNLL is 
the highest probability prediction for the corresponding feature vector.
</p>

<p>
  Extending this idea, it is possible to predict a genre for an entire 
song. To accomplish this, repeat the previous step on all the feature 
vectors of that song and average the results for each genre. The genre 
with the lowest average UNLL is the prediction.
</p>


<h2><i>k</i>-Nearest Neighbor classifier</h2>

You will now build a <i>k</i>-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>
  One of the main advantages of this type of classifier is that no 
training is required. All the classifying information is found in the 
unformatted data.
</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>
  Given a new song, calculate the Euclidean distance between each feature vector <img src="Assignment%20%232_files/v.png"> with all the feature vectors in your training set. Then find the <i>k</i> vectors with the smallest distance from <img src="Assignment%20%232_files/v.png">. Assign each vector <img src="Assignment%20%232_files/v.png"> the genre of the majority of these <i>k</i> vectors. Finally, to assign a genre to the song, find the majority class of its feature vectors.
</p>

<h2>Additional Improvements</h2>

<p>
Try to improve your score on Kaggle.
You are free to use any method, classifier or third-party library you want.
Discuss your method and how it compares to the previous two classifiers.
</p>

<h2>Note on the use of packages</h2>

<p>
  You are expected to write the algorithms for the Gaussian and <i>k</i>-NN
 classifiers. You are allowed to use a linear algebra package, e.g., 
numpy, as you see fit, as long as you write the core of the prediction 
algorithm.
</p>


<h2>Report</h2>

<p>
Your report should address the following questions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    What assumptions about the data do we make when we model the date using a Gaussian distribition?
  </li>

  <li>
    When do you expect that a Gaussian will work well and when do you think it will not work well?
  </li>

  <li>
    What values of <i>k</i> work best for the kNN classifier?
  </li>

  <li>
    Based on your results from this assignment, which classifier 
(Gaussian or kNN) works best for the task of Music Genre Classification?
  Why?
  </li>

</ol>

<h2> Submitting your assignment</h2>

<p>Your assignment must be submitted through <a href="http://moodle.cim.mcgill.ca/">moodle</a> to allow for peer- and self-assessment.  The submission must contain:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> a softcopy of your report</li>

    Trottier Engineering Linux machines
  </li>
